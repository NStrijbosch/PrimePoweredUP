# PrimePowerUP

## Current Examples:
- Spike Prime + Powerup Remote
    - 1: basic remote example for testing ble connection
    - 2: example about lighting up dot's on spike prime on button press on remote
    - 3: example to control the `advanced driving base` model from LEGO(R) with the PowerUP(TM) Remote
    
    - **NOTE: If you're using the official LEGO Spike APP to upload the code, you should just upload it and don't run it with attached console, this can be ended up in a frozen Spike Prime**
    - **NOTE: There is currently one problem: the ble code consumes lot of ressources from the spike prime, so it's necessary to restart the prime after a code execution because of mem alloc (bug)?**
